# Getting started
Running the project on the local machine requires to set up pre-packaged Vagrant box. It provides a wonderful development environment without necessity to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software.

## Requirements
* [VirtualBox 5.x](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/);
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html);
* [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/homestead);
* Domain redirect in `/etc/hosts` file:  

```
192.168.10.10   socotra.local
```

## Setting up locally
* Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), dependency manager for PHP;
* Download project dependencies:

```
composer install
```
* [Set environment configuration](#environment-configuration) in `.env` PHP dotenv file;
* Generate application key:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

* Follow guidelines under [Daily usage section](#daily-usage) to create and boot Virtual Machine to start working on the project.

## Environment configuration
We're using `.env` PHP dotenv file for environment configuration. 

1. **Please duplicate and rename `.env.example` file to `.env`.** 
2. Then set up all configurations inside (not all are required).

Here are some we wish to highlight, because they aren't obvious or clear enough:

```
# AWS key/secret issued by project owner:
# (unlocks access to S3 bucket from your local development environment)
AWS_KEY=
AWS_SECRET=

# AWS S3 bucket issued by project owner:
# (this is where user generated static resources are stored)
S3_BUCKET=

# Full path to the cache dir required by AWS:
AWS_PHP_CACHE_DIR=/full/path/to/socotra/storage/app

# Facebook SDK app client/secret issued by project owner:
# (unlocks authenticating via our test app on Facebook)
FACEBOOK_CLIENT=
FACEBOOK_SECRET=

# Google maps API key/secret issued by project owner:
# (to sign requests to Google Maps API)
GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY=
GOOGLE_MAPS_SECRET=
```

Feel free to poke project owner, if you haven't received these configurations or some doesn't work.

## Daily usage
* Pull latest source code from the remote repository via `git pull` command;
* Run `npm i` command to download latest dependencies of static assets;
* Run `vagrant up` command in project directory to create (if doesn't exist) and boot Virtual Machine;
* Open `http://socotra.local` in your favourite web browser.

Now your project directory is in sync with the Homestead environment inside Vagrant VM. Therefore any change applied to the source code is immediately available on `http://socotra.local` local website.  
_This synchronisation let's us work on the source code continuously without a necessity to restart the server._

> To just shut down Virtual Machine, run `vagrant halt` command in project directory. **Useful when temporary pausing your work** on the project with a plan to start over again soon (e.g. tomorrow);  
> To destroy Virtual Machine, use `vagrant destroy --force` command in project directory.


## Database migrations
> Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to easily modify and share the application's database schema.  
> â€” [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/migrations)

We manage database schemas and seeded test data using [Laravel Database Migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/migrations). All new migrations and database seeding are executed automatically every time Virtual Machine is created. Therefore, normally there's no need to connect to the VM via SSH and execute migrations manually.  
However, there are some use cases, migrations shall be run by hand:

* When your current VM was created before your received new migrations from a remote repository, other programmers pushed. Connect to the VM via SSH and execute migrations (see [Migrations basics](#migrations-basics)) to keep your database up to date. Or recreate (destroy and boot) your VM, so migrations are executed automatically;
* When you develop your own new migrations.

#### Migrations basics
```
# Executing migrations to make VM database up to date:
php artisan migrate

# Rolling back recently executed migration(s):
php artisan migrate:rollback
```

Please refer to [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/migrations) to learn how to develop your own database migrations.

## Connecting to VM via SSH
If there's a need to connect to the Vagrant box (Virtual Machine) via SSH command line interface, it's also possible:

```
vagrant ssh
```
This might be useful after you create an SQL migration file, which needs to be executed to populate database with modifications. // TODO: See migrations section.


## Connecting To Databases
The project is using Postgres database, which is created under Virtual Machine. It's possible to connect to the database via locally installed `psql` CLI or using any GUI database management tool (e.g. [PSequel](http://www.psequel.com/), [Navicat](https://www.navicat.com/products/navicat-for-postgresql)):

```
psql -U homestead -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54320 homestead
Password: secret
```
